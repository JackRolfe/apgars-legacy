# Apgar's Legacy

## About
Apgar's Legacy is a decision-making tool designed to facilitate simple, score-based decisions. This app is inspired by concepts discussed in Daniel Kahneman's book "Thinking, Fast and Slow", specifically from Chapter 21, "Intuitions vs. Formulas" (around the 33-minute mark in the audiobook version). The app aims to improve decision quality by reducing bias and promoting structured evaluation.

## Features
- Create customisable scoring metrics
- Evaluate options across multiple dimensions
- Generate overall scores to guide decision-making
- Minimise bias through structured assessment processes

## How It Works
1. Define key traits relevant to your decision (6 distinct dimensions is recommended)
2. Create specific questions to assess each trait
3. Score each trait on a predefined scale (e.g. 1-5)
4. Evaluate one trait at a time for all options
5. Calculate total scores to inform your final decision

## Benefits
- Promotes objective evaluation
- Reduces the impact of cognitive biases
- Improves consistency in decision-making processes
- Facilitates better hiring, project selection, or other critical choices

## Getting Started
[TBC]

## Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by concepts discussed in "Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman, particularly those related to decision-making processes and bias reduction. For a deeper understanding of these principles, it is recommended to read the original work.
